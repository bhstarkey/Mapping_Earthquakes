#### Mapping Earthquakes

To better understand the GeoJSON data available on earthquake.usgs.gov, and make use of it, we mapped out all the most recent earthquakes. We then changed the size and color of the markers to reflect the magnitude, and mapped out the tectonic plates. We added several different types of maps to view the earthquake data on, and made it possible to toggle all the earthquakes and the tectonic plates on or off.
